File Redirection
     Changing the usual input/output behavior of a program

     Command line redirection
     
     	     >
		Redirects stdout to a file
		Overwrites the contents of the file
		<COMMAND> <FILE>
		ls > file_list

	     >>
 	        Redirects stdout to a file by appending

             2>
	        Redirects stderr to a file
		Overwrites the file (2>> appends);

	     &>
	        Redirect stdout and stderr

	     <
		redirects stdin from a file 

	     | (pipe)
	        Redirect stdout from one command to stdin of the next

		ls | wc 

     Redirection in c programs
     
             dup2 - <unistd.h>
	     	  Redirect one file descriptor to another
		  
             dup2 (fd1, fd2)
	     	  Redirects fd2 to fd1

		  You will lose any reference to the original
		  fd2, that file is closed.

             dup - <unistd.h>
	     	  Duplicates an existing entrty in the file table.

		  Returns a new file descriptor for the duplicate
		  entry.

		  dup(fd)
			returns the new file descriptor

Aim: Sharing is caring!

Do Now:
   Write a simple c program that creates a child process and have the parent
   wait for the child to exit.

   Create a primitive variable in the parent before forking, then modify that
   variable in the child and print it out in both the child and parent.
